## Database Information

This project uses Apache Derby (Embedded) as the database.
The database name is `student_profiles`.

The database is created automatically at runtime using the JDBC URL:
jdbc:derby:student_profiles;create=true

Since Apache Derby Embedded stores data locally on the developer's machine,
the database files are not included in this repository.
